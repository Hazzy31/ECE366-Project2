For the final part of the project, we focused on Part (c) of Problem 1. Part(c) of the project involved combining the two previous components—Fibonacci number generation and checking if a number is odd—into a single program. The objective was to create an MIPS program that first computes the nth Fibonacci number using an iterative approach. Then, it checks whether the resulting number is odd by using division through repeated subtraction, rather than relying on the built-in DIV instruction. Finally, the program stores the result in memory, with 1 if odd and 0 if even.

For collaboration during this project, we preferred in-person discussions to decide and divide the workload effectively. We assigned different parts of the problem to each member, allowing us to focus individually on each part of the object. By working together, we were able to identify and resolve any issues or errors encountered during the project.
