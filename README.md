For this part of the project, we effectively checked for odd numbers using repeated subtraction instead of division. We collaborated closely to address logical issues and ensure we adhered to project guidelines, particularly avoiding the DIV instruction. Although we encountered a few errors while implementing the code for this section, we were able to resolve them through teamwork. Meeting in person helped us work more efficiently. Together, we successfully tested and confirmed that the final version of the code was working correctly.
